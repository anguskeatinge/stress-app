- have more in depth medical information about exactly how each thing is impacting your body
- improve weightings and final score algorithm
  - need to do more research here
  - possibly consult doctor
- generate a gpt driven response
  - give people a prompt to stick into ChatGPT
  - pre-generate a bunch of responses based on input combinations (probably need a few hundred...)
  - actually integrate chatgpt
- add references to medical studies
- stick it behind a non-vercel domain
